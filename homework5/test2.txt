C++ is a general-purpose programming language with a bias towards systems programming that

    is a better C
    supports data abstraction
    supports object-oriented programming
    supports generic programming. 

Or, in other words: C++ is a language for defining and using light-weight abstractions. It has significant strengths in areas where hardware must be handled effectively and there are significant complexity to cope with. This includes many resource constrained systems and much foundational and infrastructure code.

I (Bjarne Stroustrup) am the designer and original implementor of C++. You can find the language, the techniques for using it, and the techniques for implementing it described in my books, my papers, in hundreds of books by others, and thousands of papers by others. There are far too many to list. Try a bookstore or a library. Answers to many questions about C++ can be found in

    some interviews that I have given.
